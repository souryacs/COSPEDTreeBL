Version 1.0
-----------------

This version contains the basic source code integrating our earlier proposed supertree algorithm COSPEDTree, 
with the proposed branch length assignment. Input phylogenetic trees and their associated branch length values 
are used to assign the branch length information of the derived supertree.
